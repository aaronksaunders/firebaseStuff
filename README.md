# Mostly Firebase and Ionic Stuff

Over the past few months,  I have created a bunch of Firebase and Ionic Framework 1 and Ionic2 Sample projects to validat the technology and to help with learning the content.

I was starting to have a problem tracking it down and sending it to others so I decided to just put a list of it all here

**Ionic2 Http Request:** This is a sample showing how to do http request in Ionic

**Ionic2 Firebase3:** A very basic Ionic2 login and query realtime database sample

**Ionic2 & AngularFire2 with Facebook Auth:** AngularFire2 Integrated with Ionic2 showing email authentication with Facebook Authentication. This solution using the Facebook plugin to get tha accessToken.
I know there are othe solutions out there that use the ngOAuth plugin, but that pluging only gets you the token and then you are on your own if you want to query the Facebook API for anything else

**Ionic2 Angularfire2:** More complex application with account creation and security rules on database queries
